# Instagram_Style_Photo_Challenge
The challenge was to arrange the given 5 photos of pokemons in a collage layout as shown in the sample.

Instructions: You need to resize each pokemon 200X200 before using it. The final image should have size 430 X 430 px 

(10 border + 200 pokemon + 10 border + 200 pokemon + 10 border = 430 px) along row and column.


After that you need to convert the final image into a single .csv file of the shape (rows x cols, 3). Your accuracy will be based on percentage of values matched with our file. The CSV file should have a header "r,g,b" as column names.
